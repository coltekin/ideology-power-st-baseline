## Baseline(s) for the shared task on [Ideology and Power Identification in Parliamentary Debates](https://touche.webis.de/clef24/touche24-web/ideology-and-power-identification-in-parliamentary-debates.html)

This repository contains a simple linear baseline, and example
submission file  for the shared task on [Ideology and Power
Identification in Parliamentary Debates](https://touche.webis.de/clef24/touche24-web/ideology-and-power-identification-in-parliamentary-debates.html).

The baseline assumes that the training data is placed at `data/`
subdirectory. The training data for the shared task is proved at
<https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10450640>. If a test file is
also available, it will create a submission file. We provide both a
command line and a jupyter-notebook version of the baseline.
